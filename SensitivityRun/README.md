This is a sensitivity run for examining how sensitive are the model variables to the changes in lake stratification. This model has a simplified lake stratification dyanmics between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. It is regulated by two components, the temporal change in mixed layer depth (a forcing function for one year) and the vertical diffusive mixing coefficient (a parameter with a unit of day-1). 

We vary the lake mixing dynamics for the worst climate change scenario of our projection, RCP 8.5, in which the lake water temperature increases by 4.2 ℃ throughout the year. This number is based on literature data that are supplemented in the related publication of this work. Based on the estimation of the median change in stratification period by Woolway et al. (2021), we created a prolonged lake stratification that starts 22 days earlier and ends 11 days later (see below figure). This leads to a longer stratified period of the lake by 33 days. In another case, we reduced the diffusive mixing coefficient by 50%. This parameter determines the strength of nutrient mixing from the hypolimnion into the epilimnion, which is a realistic approximation of nutrient transportations in a lake water column (Peeters et al. 2007).

The future MLD profile can be found in the 'LakeData' named under 'ForcData_futMLD.csv'.
To run this experiment, please import the future MLD profile (1):

```
futMLD = np.genfromtxt(wd+'/ForcData_futMLD.csv', delimiter=',')
```

or modify the diffusive mixing parameter, $k$ (2) in the line of the model run:

```
sol = SizeModLogspace(mld=mld_run, par=PAR_run, sst=LWST_run, dmdt=dmdt_run, N0=N0, numP=Pnum, numYears=Ynum, k=0.05).solution
```
