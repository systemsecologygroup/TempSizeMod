### A brief description:
We used the averaged (3-year) lake nutrient and plankton data to calibrate the model, based on four results: 1.) total phytoplankton biomass(µM P); 2.) total zooplankton biomass(µM P) ; and 3.) community mean phytoplankton size(µm ESD). For the data transformation, please refer to the supporting information of the related publication of this work. 
The common unit considered for the model outputs and the data are: biomass concentration(µM P) and biovolume(µm3)
