Here contains all lake environmental data used for the model, they are: mixed layer depth (MLD), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and lake water surface temperature (Temp).

'RawData_XXX.csv' : raw, untreated data collected from lake Greifensee (Note: the temporal length and frequence do not overlap completely between MLD, PAR, and Temp) 
'ForcData_XXX.csv' : data used to force the model (input data)
'TSM_XXXX.py' : scripts used to obtain ForcData from RawData

The plots of these data are provided in the related publication (See front page).
